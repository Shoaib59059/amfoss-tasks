I could have solved many problems of hackerrank task but I got stuck in multiple test case output (when multiple inputs were feeded simultaneously and I could only provide output of single test case at a time).

I tried to solve this problem using for loop but was failed and then unfortunately I had to visit my village and I can't attempt task from 18th November to 30th.
