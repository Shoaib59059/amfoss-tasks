Rich Tony Poor Spidey....

I had done this problem but in my code I can take only 1 test case at a time but in the question It takes 2 or more than 2 test case simultaneously. So for that reason my code was getting error as expected output of 2 test case was not getting obtained and only output of single test case was printed.

I also wanted to attach that code but I had not copied that code in hurry when I had to visit village and already I have told in introspection - readme file that in village I had network issue as well as I don't have access to PC or laptop.
