__INTROSPECTION__


I could not attempt solving task problems from 18th of November as due to some reason I had to visit my village and there I don't have access to laptop and also the internet connection was very much unstable.

Why must we choose you?

I enjoy solving coding problems and in club there will be many seniors with whom I can interact and ask them for help where I got stuck. I can discuss about the idea of creating some new projects and I will be pleased being together with  my seniors.
